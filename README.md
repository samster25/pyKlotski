=========

Game play consists of mouse clicks only. You select the piece and the slot you want to
move it to. For the case of the Rectangle and the Big Square you can click any part of the piece 
and it will register to move the whole piece. The game has a move counter that increments up 
after every single move and it also counts moving a piece over two spaces as 1 move. When 
moving a piece a slot down, in the case of the bigger pieces, you can click any portion of that
piece and click the square under or below to move it once. If you want to move it two spaces, the 
same concept in selecting the piece applies, you click the second block to where you're moving 
the piece to.
